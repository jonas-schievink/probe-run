# `probe-run`

> Runs embedded programs just like native ones

`probe-run` is a custom Cargo runner that transparently runs Rust firmware on a
remote device.

`probe-run` is powered by [`probe-rs`] and thus supports as many devices and probes as
`probe-rs` does.

[`probe-rs`]: https://probe.rs/

## Features

* Acts as a Cargo runner, integrating into `cargo run`.
* Displays program output streamed from the device via RTT.
* Exits the firmware and prints a stack backtrace on breakpoints.

## Installation

To install `probe-run`, use `cargo install probe-run`.

On Linux, you might have to install `libudev` and `libusb` from your package
manager before installing `probe-run`.

## Setup

1. Set the Cargo runner

The recommend way to use `probe-run` is to set as the Cargo runner of your application.
Add this line to your Cargo configuration (`.cargo/config`) file:


``` toml
[target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
runner = "probe-run --chip ${PROBE_RUN_CHIP}"
```

Instead of `${PROBE_RUN_CHIP}` you can write the name of your microcontroller.
For example, one would use `nRF52840_xxAA` for the nRF52840 microcontroller.
To list all supported chips run `probe-run --list-chips`.

To support multiple devices, or permit overriding default behavior, you may prefer to set the
`${PROBE_RUN_CHIP}` environment variable, and set `runner` (or
`CARGO_TARGET_${TARGET_ARCH}_RUNNER`) to `probe-run`.

If you have several probes connected, you can specify which one to use by adding
the --probe option to the `runner` or setting the `${PROBE_RUN_PROBE}` environment
variable with a value containing either `${VID}:${PID}` or `${VID}:${PID}:${SERIAL}`:

```console
probe-run --probe '0483:3748' --chip ${PROBE_RUN_CHIP}
PROBE_RUN_PROBE='1366:0101:123456' cargo run
```

To list all connected probes, run `probe-run --list-probes`.

2. Enable debug info

Next check that debug info is enabled for all profiles.
If you are using the `cortex-m-quickstart` template then this is already the case.
If not check or add these lines to `Cargo.toml`.

``` toml
# Cargo.toml
[profile.dev]
debug = 1 # default is `true`; not needed if not already overridden

[profile.release]
debug = 1 # default is `false`; using `true` is also OK
```

3. Look out for old dependencies

The `cortex-m` dependency must be version 0.6.3 or newer.
Older versions are not supported.
Check your `Cargo.lock` for old versions.
Run `cargo update` to update the `cortex-m` dependency if an older one appears in `Cargo.lock`.

4. Run

You are all set.
You can now run your firmware using `cargo run`.
For example,

``` rust
use cortex_m::asm;
use cortex_m_rt::entry;
use rtt_target::rprintln;

#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    // omitted: rtt initialization
    rprintln!("Hello, world!");
    loop { asm::bkpt() }
}
```

TODO dont forget to adjust the examples

``` console
$ cargo run --bin hello
Running `probe-run target/thumbv7em-none-eabi/debug/hello`
flashing program ..
DONE
resetting device
Hello, world!
stack backtrace:
0: 0x0000031e - __bkpt
1: 0x000001d2 - hello::__cortex_m_rt_main
2: 0x00000108 - main
3: 0x000002fa - Reset
```

## Stack backtraces

When the firmware reaches a BKPT instruction the device halts. The `probe-run` tool treats this
halted state as the "end" of the application and exits with exit-code = 0. Before exiting,
`probe-run` prints the stack backtrace of the halted program.

This backtrace follows the format of the `std` backtraces you get from `std::panic!` but includes
`<exception entry>` lines to indicate where an exception/interrupt occurred.

``` rust
use cortex_m::asm;
use rtt_target::rprintln;
#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    // omitted: rtt initialization
    rprintln!("main");
    SCB::set_pendsv();
    rprintln!("after PendSV");
    loop { asm::bkpt() }
}
#[exception]
fn PendSV() {
    rprintln!("PendSV");
    asm::bkpt()
}
```

``` console
$ cargo run --bin exception --release
main
PendSV
stack backtrace:
0: 0x00000902 - __bkpt
<exception entry>
1: 0x000004de - nrf52::__cortex_m_rt_main
2: 0x00000408 - main
3: 0x000005ee - Reset
```

## Non-zero exit code

When the device raises a hard fault exception `probe-run` will print a backtrace
and exit with non-zero exit code.

You can trigger a hard fault exception with the UDF instruction.

``` rust
use cortex_m::asm;
#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    asm::udf()
}
```

``` console
$ cargo run --bin hard-fault
stack backtrace:
   0: 0x000003e0 - HardFaultTrampoline
      <exception entry>
   1: 0x00000140 - __udf
   2: 0x00000118 - cortex_m::asm::udf
   3: 0x0000012c - hard_fault::__cortex_m_rt_main
   4: 0x00000122 - main
   5: 0x000000fa - Reset

$ echo $?
134
```

**NOTE** when you run your application with `probe-run` the `HardFault` handler,
default or user-defined one, will *NOT* be executed.
